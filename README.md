# BashBox

BashBox is purely written in bash unlike other utilities out there.

Meaning you don't need heavy stuff like python. As long you can run a bash script, this also runs.

It allows you to easily do syntax-checking, beautification and optimization in tradional bash way.

# Usage

You can pass as many bash scripts you want and the output will be written in a new file with `.bb` suffix.

```bash
./bashbox bash-script.sh
```

Protip: Place `bashbox` in _PATH_  to access from anywhere.

# Future Plans

* Minification feature
* Obfuscation feature
* More command line parameters to change how bashbox works
