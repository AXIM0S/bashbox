# Introduction

Bashbox is a wannabe bash _compiler_ which aims to help create modular and maintainable bash projects.

To give huge bash codebase a predictable form. Specially for the single script bash projects with thousands of lines of code.

Bashbox compiles your modular bash project into a single file along bringing a standard set of bash enforcements to ensure that your code is safe and less error-prone while you code and test before publishing it in an production environment.

And hey, we finally have _some sort of_ `std` library for bash too! Along the ability to create your own library and let others use it.

Bashbox design is `cargo` inspired but _for the bash buddies_, so I hope that tells the rest.

## More things to write, this is incomplete at the moment
