# BashBox

BashBox is purely written in bash unlike other utilities out there.

Meaning you don't need heavy stuff like python. As long you can run a bash script, this also runs.

It allows you to easily do syntax/error-checking, beautification and optimization in tradional bash way in one shot!

# Installation & Usage

To install clone this repository into your local machine and you should be good to go.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AXIM0S/bashbox && cd bashbox
```

You can pass as many bash scripts you want and the output will be written in a new file with `.bb.sh` suffix.

```bash
./bashbox bash-script.sh
```
